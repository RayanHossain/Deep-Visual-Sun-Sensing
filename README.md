# Deep-Visual-Sun-Sensing
This project demonstrates the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the azimuth angle of the sun from a single RGB image. Accurate estimation of the sun's direction can assist in robot localization, reducing drift by leveraging the sun as a landmark. The CNN is trained to classify images into discrete bins of azimuth angles, using the KITTI dataset and the PyTorch framework.

# Key Features

- Implemented using PyTorch for deep learning.
- Predicts the azimuth angle of the sun from real-world images.
- Utilizes a CNN architecture for image-based classification.
- Designed for enhancing robot localization through sun tracking.

This project introduces basic concepts related to CNN design and provides hands-on experience working with deep learning frameworks.
